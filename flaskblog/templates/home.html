                    <p class="about-me-blurb">I'm actively looking for my next career opportunity as a software
                        engineer.<br> I have
                        a Bachelor's degree in
                        Computer Science from Wichita State University.<br> I am interested in any kind of programming
                        work that allows me to continue learning and growing:
                        front end, back end, full stack, non web-development work, et cetera. I embrace challenging
                        problems and search for innovative solutions.
                        I currently live in Wichita, Kansas, but I am interested in relocating to the right
                        place for the right job. I am also open to working 100% remotely as I have done for the past
                        year.
                        Presently,
                        the locations I am considering are the Seattle, Portland, and Denver metro areas. I look forward
                        to hearing from you if you have a position I would be a good fit for.

            <p class="mb-0"> I spent the last year working 100% remotely, even before COVID lockdowns came into place. I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy it at first, but after some time I realized how much I loved it.
                My preference for my next job would be for it to be 100% remote.
