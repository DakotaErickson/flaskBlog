        <p>
            <li>Refactored an inherited Python code base with hard coded values and paths to be more dynamic/modular,
                making the
                code base easier to work in for developers.</li>
            <li>Created a micro service in Go that returned only the necessary information to replace an API call that
                was slow
                to return and had excessive information.</li>
            <li>Implemented a UI component in Angular supporting a new underlying hardware configuration, allowing that
                configuration to be offered to customers.</li>

        <p>
            <li>Created a tool in Python that would collect/parse logs looking for specific hardware failure signatures
                using
                regex when the support team was having difficulty diagnosing hardware failures efficiently. This reduced
                turnaround time for customers.</li>
            <li>Devised and conducted a rollback test matrix to investigate which build versions were having issues,
                enabling
                the platform team to be confident in performing rollbacks.</li>
            <li>Executed a kernel fuzzing software suite to test the OS and analyzed/reported any crashes.</li>
